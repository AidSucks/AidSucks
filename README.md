Hello! My name is Aid, I'm an intermediate programmer in college.
The languages I know the best are Java, C++ and Python
I mostly just work on passion projects for little to no profit. It's part of the grind to learn more about computer science and programming in general.
If you enjoy the stuff I make then I thank you!
I'll probably add more to this file the more I become invested in programming
